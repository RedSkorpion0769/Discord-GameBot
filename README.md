My submission for the final Project in the Python course of Codedex. Its a small discordbot with a few minigames.
Few lines have no use because I planned to put more stuff in,
but I decided to not make the same mistake I did with the calculator for the Java final Project.
Will be updating it with more and better stuff in time.
